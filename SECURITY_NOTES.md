# Security & Privacy Notes

This repository is a public case study. It intentionally excludes production details.

Removed / redacted:
- Spreadsheet IDs, Script IDs, and any deployable project wiring (replaced with **(TO BE FILLED IN)**).
- Real WMS exports and any operational datasets (replaced with synthetic samples in `samples/`).
- Company-specific naming, internal identifiers, and operator metadata.

Included instead:
- Selected Apps Script snippets that demonstrate architecture, validation logic, and data merging patterns.
- Documentation describing the system without exposing production environments.
